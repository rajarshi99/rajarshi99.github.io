<h1 id="questions-and-their-answers">Questions; and their answers</h1>
<p>In academia, people at times encounter research happening in various
different frontiers. Specialists of similar fields, working at their own
respective frontiers, are able to communicate with surprising ease and
efficiency. Naturally, knowing and understanding complicated words and
their scientific or mathematical meaning is important. But it is
commonplace, as a newcomer in a research domain, to be lost in the
jargon. I begin the documentation of a sequence of questions and their
answers in order to understand the flow of ideas shaping the motivation
and background of my research work.</p>
<p><a href="q1.html">The first set</a> of questions is a dialogue
between a school kid and a PhD student. So, the stage is set with a
curious troublemaker and an unemployed youth in disguise.</p>
