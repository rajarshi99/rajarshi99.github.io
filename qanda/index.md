# Questions; and their answers

In academia,
people at times encounter research happening
in various different frontiers.
Specialists of similar fields,
working at their own respective frontiers,
are able to communicate
with surprising ease and efficiency.
Naturally,
knowing and understanding complicated words
and their scientific or mathematical meaning
is important.
But it is commonplace,
as a newcomer in a research domain,
to be lost in the jargon.
I begin the documentation
of a sequence of questions and their answers
in order to understand the flow of ideas
shaping the motivation and background
of my research work.

[The first set](q1.html) of questions is a dialogue
between a school kid and a PhD student.
So, the stage is set
with a curious troublemaker
and an unemployed youth in disguise.
