## Emergent activity network in a model of puncuated equilibrium

Find my [research work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjp/s13360-022-03581-y)
for my masters thesis project at IISER Mohali during the academic year August 2021 to April 2022.

## Ongoing Projects

> **Devlopment of BVP sovlers using GNNs**

> I am experimenting and developing BVP solvers
> which use ML techniques and operate in the FEM framework.
> It is an attempt to combine
> parametric governing equations with data,
> the two types of scientific knowledge about deterministic systems.
> Visit my in-progress [article](research/gnn4pde.html)
> and [github repo](https://github.com/rajarshi99/gnn4pde)
> to learn more about this project.

> **My website**

> An attempt at a simple and systematic way
> to create a portfolio website.
> Read more about the method philosophy and future plans
> in the repository's [README](README.html) page.
