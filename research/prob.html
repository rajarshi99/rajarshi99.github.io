<p>In Science and Engineering, quantities which are continuous functions
of space and time are modelled as a BVP. In a BVP, we are given a
domain, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to be solved and the
constraints to be imposed at the boundary of the domain. As an example,
simulation of the airflow around an airfoil is modelled by a BVP.
Airfoils are objects of shapes which can, for favourable airflow,
generate lift (countering the gravitational forces) like the wings of a
turbine or aircraft. For airflow simulation, the Navier-Stokes Equations
(NSE) describe the physics at each point in the domain in the form of
PDEs. To specify the inflow, outflow and the friction of the air with
the airfoil we impose boundary conditions on the velocity and pressure
at the surface of the airfoil and a rectangle around the airfoil marking
the region of interest as described in figure . The first step for
numerically solving such PDEs, is to generate a mesh over the region of
interest. The FEM with nodal basis functions for a good quality mesh and
appropriate element sizes provide accurate and reliable solutions, but
computational power can be a limiting factor in obtaining solutions of
the desired accuracy. Our research is focused on balancing the
computational cost and accuracy to find an optimal mesh while exploiting
the parallel computing possibilities.</p>
<p>Time-independent BVPs capture the steady state of the system, while
time-dependent ones capture the evolution. A steady state occurs when
the system no longer changes significantly with time and the transience
has died down. The Reynolds number, a dimensionless quantity
representing the ratio of inertial to viscous forces, is a measure of
turbulence in the system. Higher Reynolds numbers often necessitate
finer grids and smaller time steps to resolve turbulent features like
eddies and vortices while maintaining numerical stability.</p>
