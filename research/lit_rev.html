<h1 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h1>
<p>In academia, people at times encounter research happening in various
different frontiers. Specialists of similar fields, working at their own
respective frontiers, are able to communicate with surprising ease and
efficiency. Naturally, knowing and understanding complicated words and
their scientific or mathematical meaning is important. But it is
commonplace, as a newcomer in a research domain, to be lost in the
jargon. I begin the documentation to give the motivation and background
in a simple and friendly manner.</p>

<p>Let us first look into the example of <a
href="lin_elasc2d/notes.pdf">2D linear elasticity</a> problem in the
paper. A neural network is trained which has inputs</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Boundary geometry: Chosen from a set of polygons of 6-8
edges</p></li>
<li><p>Boundary condition: Each edge can have only one of the following
three types of boundary conditions.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>BC1: zero displacement</li>
<li>BC2: specified uniform traction in a given range</li>
<li>BC3: unconstrained; which means zero traction</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Material parameters: Poisson’s ratio and density in a given
range</p></li>
<li><p>Point in the domain</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The output of the NN is the target area upper bound A. The training
is carried out in a supervised fashion the key steps to be followed are
given below.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a list of problems by choosing the boundary geometry,
boundary condition, Poisson’ ratio etc and parameterise them. So, each
problem can be assigned a set of numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Numerically solve each problem for a Low Density Uniform Mesh
(LDUM) to get a Low Accuracy Solution (LAS) and a High Density Uniform
Mesh (HDUM) to get a High Accuracy Solution (HAS).</p></li>
<li><p>Let P_i be the parameters of the i-th problem. x_j be the center
of the j-th element in the LDUM of the i-th problem and E_ij be the
error approximate for the j-th element in the LDUM of the i-th problem.
To find E_ij the HAS and LAS are used. The NN is trained to minimise the
loss</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>mean square (NN(P_i, x_j) - 1/E_ij).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now for an unseen problem we can get the target area upper bound A.
This is used by the Triangle package to form the non-uniform mesh.</p>
