<p>In academia, people at times encounter research happening in various
different frontiers. Specialists of similar fields, working at their own
respective frontiers, are able to communicate with surprising ease and
efficiency. Naturally, knowing and understanding complicated words and
their scientific or mathematical meaning is important. But it is
commonplace, as a newcomer in a research domain, to be lost in the
jargon. I begin the documentation to give the motivation and background
in a simple and friendly manner.</p>

<p>Let us first look into the example of <a
href="lin_elasc2d/notes.pdf">2D linear elasticity</a> problem in the
paper. They consider a set of polygon domains of 6-8 edges where each
edge can have only one of the following three types of boundary
conditions. 1. Zero displacement (Dirichlet) 2. Specified uniform
traction (Neumann) 3. Unconstrained (Neumann)</p>
