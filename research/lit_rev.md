# Literature Review

In academia,
people at times encounter research happening
in various different frontiers.
Specialists of similar fields,
working at their own respective frontiers,
are able to communicate
with surprising ease and efficiency.
Naturally,
knowing and understanding complicated words
and their scientific or mathematical meaning
is important.
But it is commonplace,
as a newcomer in a research domain,
to be lost in the jargon.
I begin the documentation
to give the motivation and background
in a simple and friendly manner.
