Let us consider the 2 dimensional Poisson's problem
with manufactured solutions.
Let $\Omega$ be a square domain.
In this domain,
the Poisson's equation would be the following.
\begin{align}
  &\pdbder{u}{x} + \pdbder{u}{y} + f(x,y) = 0 & \forall (x,y) \in \Omega
  \label{poi2d}
\end{align}
In the method of manufactured solutions,
we choose an analytical expression,
let it be $u_s$,
and plug it for $u(x,y)$ in equation \ref{poi2d}
to manufacture the forcing function $f_m(x,y)$.
Now we formulate the BVP to be solved numerically
\begin{align*}
  &\pdbder{u}{x} + \pdbder{u}{y} + f_m(x,y) = 0 & \forall (x,y) \in \Omega \\
  &u(x,y) = u_s(x,y) & \forall (x,y) \in \partial \Omega
\end{align*}
where $\partial \Omega$ is the boundary of the square domain.
Let $u_h$ be the function obtained by the numerical solver.
Now,
$u_h$ and $u_s$ can be compared
to gauge the performance of the numerical solver.
